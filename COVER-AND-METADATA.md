## AMAZON KDP METADATA

### Title & Description

**Title:** Ironbound

**Subtitle:** A Romantasy Novel

**Series:** (Leave blank or "The Alchemist Chronicles, Book 1" if planning series)

---

### BOOK DESCRIPTION (Amazon Blurb)

```
When alchemist Elara Thorne accidentally binds her magic to an exiled Fae prince, she discovers the curse will consume them both—unless they can learn to trust each other before it's too late.

Elara has spent years perfecting her craft, manipulating metals with a touch and following in her mother's mysterious footsteps. But when a forbidden ritual goes catastrophically wrong, her magic tangles with that of Prince Caelum Aeloria—a Fae noble exiled from his court and desperate to reclaim what was stolen from him.

Now they're bound by a curse that's slowly killing them both. If it consumes Elara, she'll become a void alchemist, destroying everything she touches. If it consumes Caelum, he'll fragment between worlds, dying as both mortal and Fae reject him.

To break the curse, they must infiltrate the Seelie Court and confront Lady Seraphina—the woman who orchestrated Caelum's exile and deliberately engineered their binding. But as they navigate enchanted forests, face deadly illusions, and unravel the secrets of Elara's bloodline, the line between curse and connection begins to blur.

Some bindings can't be broken by force. Some require a different kind of magic entirely.

Perfect for fans of Sarah J. Maas, Jennifer L. Armentrout, and Holly Black.
