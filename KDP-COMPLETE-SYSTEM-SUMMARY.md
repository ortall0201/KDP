## 🔥 PRO TIPS FROM 10+ YEARS EXPERIENCE

### What Actually Works

1. **Niche Research is Everything**
   - Spend 50% of time finding golden opportunities
   - One great niche > 10 mediocre niches
   - Use the automated system religiously

2. **Quality > Quantity (But Both Matter)**
   - 50 good books > 100 mediocre books
   - But 100 good books > 50 good books
   - Always review AI content

3. **The Catalog Compound Effect**
   - Book #1: $50/month
   - Book #30: Still $50/month
   - Total: $1,500/month passive income
   - This is the real magic

4. **Test, Measure, Optimize**
   - Kill books earning <$20/month after 3 months
   - Double down on winners
   - Create series from bestsellers

5. **Compliance is Non-Negotiable**
   - ALWAYS check AI disclosure box
   - Follow 3 books/day limit
   - Provide real reader value
   - Think long-term business

### What Doesn't Work

❌ Publishing low-quality AI spam
❌ Ignoring Amazon's policies
❌ Copying successful books exactly
❌ Not investing in covers ($5-50 each)
❌ Giving up after 10 books
❌ Trying to game the system
